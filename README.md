This project contains two different tasks: <br/>
1. Detection of the chessboard location and the angle it presents in the image. 
2. Detection of what chess pieces are in each house on the board.

This project is programmed in C# Visual Studio 2015. All the functions were created with core C# objects, without using OpenCV or EmguCV functions. <br/>

A user interface is provided in order to compare the created functions with EmguCV functions and test the chess recognition algorithm. <br/>
